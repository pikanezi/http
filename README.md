Http
====

Override of net/http and gorilla/pat golang library to use JSON with Request and ResponseWritter in a more easy way.

Its purpose is to create web server sending and receiving JSON data in few lines.

See documentation of gorilla/pat here : http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/pat

```go

import (
	"github.com/pikanezi/http"
	"log"
)

type Object struct {
	SomeField string `json:"someField,omitempty"`
}

func HelloWorldHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) *http.Error {
	object := &Object{"Hello World"}
	w.WriteJSON(object)
	return nil
}

func AdminHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) *http.Error {
	w.WriteJSON("Hello Admin!")
	return nil
}

func CheckAdminInterceptor(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) *http.Error {
	// Check if user is an Admin
	return nil
}


func main() {
	r := http.NewRouter()
    
	// Set the custom headers to be set before the Handler handle the request.
	// It is useful for handling the CORS.
	r.SetCustomHeader(http.Header{
		"Access-Control-Allow-Origin":      domainCORS,
		"Access-Control-Allow-Methods":     "POST, GET, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE",
		"Access-Control-Allow-Headers":     "Content-Type, Authorization, Accept, x-api-key",
		"Access-Control-Allow-Max-Age":     "604800",
		"Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": "true",
	})
	
	r.Get("/hello/world", HelloWorldHandler).Before(CheckAdminInterceptor)
    
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", r)
}
