Http
====

Override of net/http and gorilla/pat golang library to use JSON with Request and ResponseWritter in a more easy way.

Its purpose is to create web server sending and receiving JSON data in few lines.

See documentation of gorilla/apt here : http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/pat

```go
import (
    "github.com/pikanezi/http"
    "log"
)

const (
    KEY = "SECRET_KEY"
)

func SecureHook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) *http.Error {
    if r.Header.Get("x-api-key") != KEY {
        return &http.Error{Error:"Wrong API Key", HttpCode: 403}
    }
    return nil
}

type Object struct {
    SomeField string `json:"someField,omitempty"`
}

func HelloWorldHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) *http.Error {
    object := &Object{"Hello World"}
    if err := w.WriteJSON(object); err != nil {
        return &http.Error{Error: err.Error()
    }
}

func main() {

    // NewRouter takes the domain to authorize it cross-domains requests
    r := http.NewRouter("example.com")
    
    // Add a Hook, every Hooks will be executed before executing an Handler
    r.AddHooks(SecureHook)
    
    r.Get("/hello/world", HelloWorldHandler)
    
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", r)
}
